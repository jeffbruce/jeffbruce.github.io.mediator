Welcome to my personal website.  If you don't know much about me, this page is for you.  For anyone else, stay awhile; [Jeeves](http://askjeeves.com) is somewhere around here serving hors d'oeuvres, and there's some punch by the door if you feel so inclined.

I'm a programmer / statistician living and working in Toronto, Canada.  I love learning and creating and am regularly overwhelmed by my ideas.  One outlet for me has always been music, which I've been composing since I was about 13 years old.  When I'm not working or creating, in all likelihood you'll probably find me outdoors playing a sport, running, hiking, or indoors pigging out on some glorious foodâ€”the term glorious in this context is pretty much exclusively reserved for curries.  

With this site, I'm hoping to write more regularly about topics that I'm interested in, as well as share some of the creations I'll be dreaming up with a wider audience.  If you ever feel like collaborating on anything, please get in touch.  I'm a friendly soul, I swear.
